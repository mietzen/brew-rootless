# Homebrew's MCP Server

Homebrew's MCP Server is the official MCP ([Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)) server for Homebrew, enabling AI assistants like Cursor, VS Code or Claude Code to interact with Homebrew directly, providing tools for various Homebrew commands e.g. `brew search`, `brew install`, `brew uninstall`, `brew upgrade`.

You don't need to do anything to install it.
It's provided by default with Homebrew through the `brew mcp-server` command.

## Usage

Run `brew mcp-server` to launch the Homebrew MCP Server.

```bash
$ brew mcp-server
==> Started Homebrew MCP server...
```

Press Ctrl-D or Ctrl-C to terminate it.
